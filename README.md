The FRee Adaptable Modular Editor for Panda3D.

This application will give home to multiple editors like a scene editor, gui editor and many others to come. It will automatically embed installed and supported editors.

Currently those are:

The Scene Editor
PyPI:
https://pypi.org/project/SceneEditor/
GitHub:
https://github.com/fireclawthefox/SceneEditor

and

The DirectGUI designer
PyPI:
https://pypi.org/project/DirectGuiDesigner/
GitHub:
https://github.com/fireclawthefox/DirectGuiDesigner

Once they are installed on your system, they will appear in FRAME and can be selected from the left sidebar. They will work the same as if run standalone.
