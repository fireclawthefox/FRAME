# FRAME

**NOTE:** This is currently heavily work in progress and is not intended for productive use yet.

The FRee Adaptable Modular Editor for Panda3D.

This application will give home to multiple editors like a scene editor, gui editor and many others to come. It will automatically embed installed and supported editors.

Currently those are:

https://github.com/fireclawthefox/SceneEditor

and

https://github.com/fireclawthefox/DirectGuiDesigner

Once they are installed on your system using python setup tools (or once uploaded through pip), they will appear in FRAME and can be selected from the left sidebar.
